<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Calcined Magnesium Oxide Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Caustic Calcined (Light Burned)</li><li>Heavy Burned</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Calcined magnesium oxide is available in two main types: Caustic Calcined (Light Burned) and Heavy Burned. Caustic Calcined magnesium oxide is produced by heating magnesium carbonate at a lower temperature, resulting in a light white powder with high reactivity. Heavy Burned magnesium oxide is produced by heating magnesium carbonate at a higher temperature, resulting in a denser and less reactive powder. These different types have varying applications in industries such as agriculture, construction, and healthcare based on their properties.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Spine Bone Stimulators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive Stimulators</li><li>Non-Invasive Stimulators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Spinal bone stimulators are medical devices used to promote bone healing and fusion. Invasive stimulators require a surgical procedure to implant the device directly adjacent to the affected area, while non-invasive stimulators are placed externally on the skin. Both types work by delivering electrical or electromagnetic stimulation to the bone, promoting bone growth and healing. Invasive stimulators are typically used for more severe cases where direct bone contact is necessary, while non-invasive stimulators are used for less severe cases or as a non-surgical alternative.</p></p>

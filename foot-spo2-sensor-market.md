<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Foot SpO2 Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Disposable</li><li>Reusable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Foot SpO2 sensors are commonly available in two main types - disposable and reusable. Disposable sensors are designed for single use and are typically more cost-effective for healthcare facilities. Reusable sensors, on the other hand, can be used multiple times after proper sterilization. While disposable sensors are preferred for one-time use in certain situations such as surgeries, reusable sensors are more sustainable and cost-effective for long-term monitoring of patients in clinical settings. Both types offer accurate and reliable monitoring of oxygen saturation levels in the blood.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Range Finder Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Laser</li><li>Ultrasonic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Range finders are electronic devices used to measure distances accurately. They are available in two main market types: laser and ultrasonic. Laser range finders use laser beams to measure distances by bouncing them off a target, providing precise measurements even over long distances. Ultrasonic range finders, on the other hand, use sound waves to determine distances, making them ideal for indoor use or in situations where laser beams may not be practical. Both types of range finders offer advanced technology for accurate distance measurements.</p></p>

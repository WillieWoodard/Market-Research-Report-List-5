<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Medical Ultrasonic Cutter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact</li><li>Non-contact</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Medical ultrasonic cutters can be classified into two main types: contact and non-contact. Contact ultrasonic cutters require direct physical contact with the target material to perform cutting or dissecting procedures. On the other hand, non-contact ultrasonic cutters use ultrasonic waves to cut through materials without physically touching them. Each type has its own advantages and use cases in various medical applications. Contact cutters are often used for precise and controlled cutting, while non-contact cutters are ideal for delicate and sensitive tissues.</p></p>

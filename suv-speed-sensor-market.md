<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The SUV Speed Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active</li><li>Passive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The SUV speed sensor market can be classified into two main types: active and passive. Active speed sensors require an external power source to operate and actively send out signals to measure speed. On the other hand, passive speed sensors do not require an external power source and detect speed by responding to external stimuli. Both types of speed sensors play a crucial role in accurately measuring the speed of SUVs and ensuring smooth driving experiences for the users.</p></p>

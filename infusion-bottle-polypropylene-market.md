<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Infusion Bottle Polypropylene Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>PP-H</li><li>PP-R</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Infusion Bottle Polypropylene market consists of two main types: PP-H and PP-R. PP-H, or polypropylene homopolymer, is a type of polypropylene with high crystallinity and stiffness, making it ideal for applications requiring high heat resistance and chemical resistance. On the other hand, PP-R, or polypropylene random copolymer, has a random arrangement of monomer units, resulting in improved impact resistance and flexibility compared to PP-H. Both types are widely used in the manufacturing of infusion bottles for medical applications.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Respiratory Virus Vaccines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Inactivated Vaccines</li><li>Live-attenuated Vaccines</li><li>Recombinant Vaccines</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Respiratory virus vaccines market consists of three main types of vaccines: inactivated vaccines, live-attenuated vaccines, and recombinant vaccines. Inactivated vaccines contain virus particles that have been killed and are unable to replicate, providing immunity without causing the disease. Live-attenuated vaccines contain weakened live viruses that stimulate an immune response without causing illness. Recombinant vaccines are made by inserting genes from a virus into a different virus or bacterial cell to stimulate an immune response. Each type of vaccine has its own advantages and limitations in preventing respiratory virus infections.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Artificial Shoulder Replacements Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cemented Prostheses</li><li>Uncemented Prostheses</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Artificial shoulder replacements are categorized into two main types: cemented prostheses and uncemented prostheses. Cemented prostheses involve anchoring the shoulder implant to the bone using bone cement, providing immediate stability and allowing for weight-bearing activities soon after surgery. Uncemented prostheses, on the other hand, rely on the bone growing into the implant over time to secure it in place. Both types have their advantages and drawbacks, and the choice between them depends on factors such as the patient's age, activity level, and bone quality.</p></p>
